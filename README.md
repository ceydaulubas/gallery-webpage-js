# Happy Gllery

The primary aim of this project is to duplicate the provided website as accurately as possible using React and Bootstrap. I'm harnessing the power and flexibility of these libraries to faithfully reproduce the design, layout, and functionality of the original website.

In addition to the direct reproduction of the website, we're leveraging an external API to fetch and display images in various parts of the website. This helps showcase the seamless integration of external data resources into a React and Bootstrap project, adding to its dynamic and interactive nature.

By using the Axios library, I'm retrieving images from the API and setting them into our application's state using the useState hook. These images are then displayed on the website within their designated picture frames.

Through this endeavor, I'm hoping to not only create a perfect replica of the original website but also demonstrate the dynamic capabilities of a modern React application paired with Bootstrap and external APIs.
